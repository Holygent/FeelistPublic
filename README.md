# Feelist
Feelist is a relationship-based app.

It is available worldwide on iOS 17.0 or later, iPadOS 17.0 or later, macOS 14.0 or later, and visionOS 1.0 or later.
Despite its compatibility, the app keeps the iOS design regardless of the software the user's on.


Feelist allows people to see how much they like and love people in a questionnaire- or slider-based way. The app generates from the responses a descending list of people the user prefers the most, as well as a percentage preference and a description for each person.

Other features include Lists which allows users to share multiple people together, Map which allows users to see where their friend is and react to their location, and more.


Feelist uses Firebase to make the user's data available on all their devices, let them join a List and share their location, process analytics, and more.
Firebase-related files and information are not included in this repository for security purposes. However, non-risky functions like read or write may be found here.
