# [About Feelist](./README.md)
Feelist is a relationship-based app.
<br><br>
**Description**
<br>
Feelist allows people to see how much they like and love people in a questionnaire- or slider-based way. The app generates from the responses a descending list of people the user prefers the most, as well as a percentage preference and a description for each person.
<br><br>
Other features include Lists which allows users to share multiple people together, Map which allows users to see where their friend is and react to their location, and more.
<br><br>
**Network**
<br><br>
Feelist uses Firebase to make the user's data available on all their devices, let them join a List and share their location, process analytics, and more.
> [!NOTE]
> Firebase-related files and information are not included in this repository for security purposes. However, non-risky functions like read or write may be found across the repo.

**Availability**
<br><br>
Feelist was developed exclusively for Apple platforms, somewhat due to my knowledge limitations on Android.
<br><br>
The app is available worldwide on TestFlight as a Beta under v0.2.1 on iOS 17.0 or later, iPadOS 17.0 or later, macOS 14.0 or later, and visionOS 1.0 or later.
<br>
Despite its compatibility, the app keeps the iOS layout regardless of the software the user's on but I'm working on adding dynamic layout for v1.
